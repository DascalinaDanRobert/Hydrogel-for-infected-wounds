# Hydrogel for infected wounds
In this study, gelatin and polyvinylpyrrolidone hydrogels loaded with doxycycline were developed. Four samples were prepared, each containing different concentrations of gelatin and doxycycline. These samples were subjected to swelling, degradation, cell viability, and antibacterial tests, as well as FTIR and Micro-CT analyses.
- Developed gelatin-polyvinylpyrrolidone-doxycycline hydrogels for infected wound treatment, demonstrating expertise in biomaterial synthesis and characterization.
- Conducted FTIR spectroscopy and micro-CT analysis to evaluate hydrogel porosity and chemical interactions, ensuring optimal tissue regeneration properties.
- Performed stability and cytotoxicity tests (LDH assay) to validate hydrogel biocompatibility and antibacterial efficacy for medical applications.
