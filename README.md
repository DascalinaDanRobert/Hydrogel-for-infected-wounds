# Hydrogel for infected wounds
In this study, gelatin and polyvinylpyrrolidone hydrogels loaded with doxycycline were developed. Four samples were prepared, each containing different concentrations of gelatin and doxycycline. These samples were subjected to swelling, degradation, cell viability, and antibacterial tests, as well as FTIR and Micro-CT analyses.
